# The Movie Library

A modern movie library application developed with TanStack Start and using the TMDB API.

## Frontend Developer Coding Challenge

This project is a coding challenge for frontend developers to demonstrate skills in modern web technologies, UX/UI design, and development capabilities.

**Challenge Overview:**
Develop a web application that displays a movie list with search, filter, and sort functionality. Users should be able to click on movies to view detailed information.

**Required Technologies:**

- Framework: TanStack Start
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- API: TMDB (The Movie Database)
- Code Management: Git

**Key Features to Implement:**

- Movie list display
- Search functionality by title
- Filter by genres
- Sort by various criteria (popularity, date, rating)
- Detailed movie view
- Responsive design

**Note:** Due to TMDB API limitations, the search endpoint doesn't support genre filtering. The implementation uses client-side filtering when combining search with genres, which means infinite scroll loads search results and filters them locally - you may need to scroll further to see more filtered results.

## Features

- **Movie Discovery**: Browse popular movies from the TMDB database
- **Movie Search**: Search for specific movies by title
- **Advanced Filters**: Filter movies by genres and sort by popularity, release date, rating, etc.
- **Detailed Movie Views**: View comprehensive information including cast, crew, ratings, and metadata
- **Infinite Scrolling**: Automatically load more movies as you scroll
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between themes with persistent preference
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Loading States**: Smooth skeleton loading animations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

## Architecture

- **API Layer**: Lightweight client utilities that directly access the TMDB API
- **Type Safety**: Zod schemas for runtime validation + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component system
- **Loading**: Route-level loading.tsx + component-level skeleton states

## Deployment

The application can be deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

```bash
pnpm build
```

Make sure to set the environment variables in your deployment platform.
